# Slack {#slack status=draft}

Many of the Duckietown communities use Slack for private messaging.


## Installing the Slack app on Linux

See [here](https://slack.com/downloads/linux)


## Disabling Slack email notifications {#disable-slack-emails}

Most importantly, please take the time to disable email notification for Slack.

The point of Slack is that you don't get email. You can work on Duckietown
only when you have the time to do so.

## Disabling Slack pop-up notification on the desktop {#disable-slack-notifications}

Also remove pop up notifications from the app. It should be a discrete notification that says "hey, when you have some time, look at Twist", not "HEY HEY HEY PAY ATTENTION TO ME NOW".
